									<h2><a href="https://github.com/Kaledia/Project_DataAnalysis_ChemicalEngineeringResearch_Excel">Data Analysis with Excel of Chemical Engineering Research<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>Project performed during my class of Statistical Principles in Engineering at Lamar University for the Master in Chemical Engineering in Spring 2018 
										Teacher: Dr Xinyu Liu, Associate Professor

										We answered the following questions during this project:
										
										1. Do the results prove that algae absorb a significant amount of photon?
										2. The results are not the same for the different positions as they should be. Can you prove that these values are close enough? If not, determine positions or values are very far from average, to exclude these positions in future experiments.
										3. The values of absorption of photon to be exploited, must be greater than the limit of 80 μmol.s-1m-2 . Is that the case?
										4. Some additional experiments were done to compare the impact of day length on photon absorption of culture. The cultures were exposed to different cycles of light and dark (08:16 hours, 10:14h, 12:12h, 14:10h and 16:8h). How does the day length impact the capacity of absorption of algae?
										
										The tools we used to answer these 4 questions are: 
										For question 1: Confidence intervals on the difference between 2 means (to compare the measurements of photon flux in water and in culture). 
										For question 2: Box plot (to determine outliers). 
										For question 3: Hypothesis testing for one variable. 
										For question 4: Simple linear regression.

										Abstract: Two activated carbons were prepared based on peanut shell (CAA) and green soya shell (CAS) at 500 °C during 6 h after impregnation in soda. Without impregnation in soda, two non-activated carbons were prepared in the same conditions, from peanut shell (CNAA) and green soya shell (CNAS). To compare, we characterized two commercial activated carbons. The first, CACOM 1, was bought in a drug store and the second, CACOM 2 was bought in a shop of chemical products. The ash content of all carbons was lower than 12 %, except CACOM 1 (42 %). The presence of excipients is certainly the reason of the high ash content of CACOM 1. The pH values of all carbons except CACOM 2 changed from 7.35 to 7.73. The pH value of CACOM 2 is 9.24.The determination of the specific surfaces of carbon was carried out according to the model of Langmuir with the molecule of acetic acid. The specific surfaces of CNAA, CNAS, CAA, CAS, CACOM 2 and CACOM 1 are respectively 141.47 m2/g, 194.46 m2/g, 311.15 m2/g, 433.09 m2/g, 514.32 m2/g and 1206,30 m2/g. The specific surfaces of CAA and CAS are closer than the commercial carbon CACOM 2. Keywords: activated carbon, peanut shell, green soya shell, acetic acid, Langmuir.

										Title: Adsorption of acetic acid on different carbons ABSTRACT This study presents a double environmental aspect, on one hand, decline of the cost of the waste water treatment thanks to a cheap adsorbing, on the other hand, the valuation of coconut shells. The acetic acid was used as adsorbent because the knowledge of the size of its molecule (21 Å2) allows characterizing studied carbons. The model of Langmuir describes well the isotherms of adsorption on the various types of studied carbons. It stands out in this study that the capacity of adsorption of inactivated carbon grain (CNAG COCO) doubles practically if this one is reduced in powder. Besides, the inactivated carbon powder (CNAP COCO) and the activated carbon grain (CAG COCO) have the same capacity of adsorption. So, the specific surfaces of the CNAP COCO and CAG COCO are identical: SL = 77 m2/g while that of the CNAG is only 32 m2/g. The use of inactivated carbon powder can be thus recommended to treat waste water opposite the inactivated grain carbon which isn’t of real interest. Key words: Acetic acid ; adsorption ; carbon ; Langmuir.
